# Vision

Our goal is to bring every Cambodian internet user into the blockchain space. 

We aim to do this by providing and supporting businesses, developers, and partners with the tools they need to build Web3 wallets for their existing and new users. We also aim to achieve this through use cases like cross-organization loyalty programs, reward exchanges, and settlement service and various tokenization methods. We envision Selendra as a launchpad for these users to access other blockchain networks.
