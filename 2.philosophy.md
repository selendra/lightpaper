## Philosophy

We believe in a multi-chain future with numerous chains, each hosting a diverse array of users and assets. In this context, we've introduced Selendra: a smart contract platform designed to offer both Wasm and EVM-compatible environment for crafting decentralized applications. Selendra was purpose-built to serve the evolving landscape of assets and users spanning multiple blockchain networks.

Traditional smart contract platforms are primarily engineered to cater to users and assets residing on a single, specific chain. Selendra, through its cross-chain smart contract functionality, empowers developers to smoothly transfer existing workloads and logic to the Selendra platform. This extension facilitates broader access to new users and assets across various chains.

Selendra's cross-chain integration is achieved by becoming a parachain or parathread on the Polkadot network. The Polkadot network serves as a hub for integration and connectivity among parachain network, connecting them to external non-Polkadot chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin through bridges.

## Who Benefits from Selendra

Selendra's cross-chain functionality benefits three main user groups:

1. **Existing Ethereum-Based Projects**
   - Projects grappling with Ethereum's cost and scalability issues can migrate portions of their workloads to Selendra with minimal adjustments.
   - They can opt for a hybrid approach where applications coexist on both Ethereum and Selendra, expanding their reach to the Polkadot network and other connected chains.

2. **Polkadot Ecosystem Projects**
   - Ecosystem projects seeking smart contract functionality can enhance their existing parachains and parathreads.
   - These projects can introduce new features that may be lacking on the main Polkadot relay chain, such as crowdfunding mechanisms, lockdrops, and complex financial transactions.

3. **Developers of New DApps**
   - Individuals and teams venturing into Polkadot development can leverage Selendra to access specialized functionality from Polkadot parachains while reaching users and assets on other chains.
   - Selendra serves as a lightweight integration layer, simplifying the process of aggregating network services for developers. This pre-built integration on a smart contract platform offers a faster and easier alternative to building a complete Substrate runtime and conducting integrations from scratch.

Key Features and Functionality
Selendra accomplishes these objectives through a set of key features:

- **Decentralized and Permissionless**: Ensuring censorship resistance and accommodating a wide range of existing and future DApp use cases.

- **Full EVM Implementation**: Supporting Solidity-based smart contracts with minimal migration effort and expected execution outcomes.

- **Web3 RPC API**: Allowing seamless migration of existing DApp front-ends with minimal adjustments. Selendra is compatible with popular Ethereum-based tools like Truffle, Remix, and MetaMask without any modification.

- **Substrate Ecosystem Compatibility**: Interoperability with the Substrate ecosystem toolset, encompassing block explorers, front-end development libraries, and wallets.

- **Native Cross-Chain Integration**: Facilitated through the Polkadot network and token bridges, enabling token movement, state visibility, and message passing with Ethereum and other chains.

- **On-Chain Governance**: Empowering stakeholders to swiftly and seamlessly evolve the base protocol according to the needs of developers and the community.

This unique blend of features addresses a strategic market gap while positioning Selendra to cater to the evolving requirements of developers as the Polkadot network expands. Building a chain from scratch using Substrate is powerful but entails additional responsibilities such as mastering the chain's runtime in Rust, creating a token economy, and incentivizing a node operator community.

For many developers and projects, Selendra's Ethereum-compatible smart contract approach offers a simpler and faster implementation alternative. By constructing these smart contracts on Selendra, developers can seamlessly integrate with other chains and harness the value of Polkadot-based network effects.
