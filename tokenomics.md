# Selendra Tokenomics

Upon full deployment, the Selendra Network will be governed by its token holders. Selendra is characterized by its complete openness, public accessibility, and permissionless nature. The majority of tokens will be distributed among the community, incentivized team, and the Selendra Trust. Notably, 70% of the Selendra Foundation's tokens will be burned, by 2030, to reduce token circulation and advance decentralization. The remaining 30% will be earmarked to support community development and incentivize developers.

Furthermore, the Selendra Network introduces a staking mechanism to incentivize node operation and active participation by nominators in the network's expansion. This inclusive approach ensures community involvement in shaping the network's future.
