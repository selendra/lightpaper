1. **Introduction**

Selendra, a proof-of-stake blockchain, was designed and developed from the ground up utilizing the Substrate framework as its foundation. It's a multi virtual machine, compatible with both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly, allows developers to write Smart Contracts using tools they already know. Ethereum and other EVM base networks developers can move code to Selendra with minimal effort, benefiting from near-zero fees for transactions and smart contract deployments.

Selendra's mission is not to compete with or replace established blockchain networks like Ethereum, but to empower developers in developing nations by providing them with the tools and resources needed to leverage blockchain technology. This includes onboarding individuals, private enterprises, and other stakeholders, particularly in countries like Cambodia, to utilize blockchain solutions and become part of the broader decentralized network of blockchains.

Blockchain and its applications, like other internet-based applications, fundamentally rely on the internet to operate. While the purpose and use cases of each network vary based on protocol design and community adoption, they collectively contribute to the creation of a new generation of the internet through their interconnectedness and mutual empowerment. Bitcoin, for instance, initially conceived as a decentralized, cross-border currency, has evolved to explore its potential as a digital store of value, paving the way for other protocols to address additional gaps within the ecosystem.

Rather than assuming a single blockchain's dominance over the entire industry, we recognize the improbability of such a scenario. Our dedication lies in promoting the growth and adoption of blockchain technology. We aim to introduce new users and business applications to diverse networks, ranging from established platforms like Ethereum to promising newcomers. By doing so, we contribute to the expansion and development of the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.
