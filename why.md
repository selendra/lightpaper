## Why Building Selendra and Why Building on Substrate?

**Why We're Building Selendra**

In an era where blockchain technology has transitioned from a centralized, server-based internet (Web2) to a decentralized, distributed one (Web3), Selendra plays a crucial role. Web3 introduces decentralization (no single point of failure), censorship resistance, and permissionless access, enabling novel decentralized applications (dApps) and assets like DeFi, DEX, NFTs, and more.

The blockchain industry is still in its infancy, offering significant growth potential. The demand for Web3 developers has surged, signifying rapid adoption. Selendra was conceived to become an essential platform, nurturing the Web3 ecosystem's expansion.

**Why Build with Substrate**

After thorough research, we opted to build Selendra using the Substrate development framework and deploy it initially as an independent network. This approach allows us to focus on crafting use cases directly addressing enterprises' and developers' needs. As our developer community grows and demands scalability and interoperability, we can seamlessly integrate Substrate's toolkit, incorporating off-chain rollup for scalability, bridging methods, or parachains for interoperability with Polkadot.

Substrate aligns seamlessly with Selendra's technical requirements, offering a multitude of functionalities out of the box, such as peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, governance features, a Wasm contract pallet, an EVM implementation, and more.

In essence, adopting Substrate significantly reduces the time and effort required for realizing the Selendra project. Substrate's flexibility enables extensive customization, crucial for achieving our vision. Furthermore, utilizing Rust provides both safety assurances and performance optimizations.

Selendra's selection of the Substrate development framework represents a strategic decision rooted in several key advantages:

**1. Rapid Development and Deployment:** Substrate streamlines the development process, offering a wealth of functionalities out of the box. These include peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, governance features, a Wasm contract pallet, an EVM implementation, and more. Leveraging Substrate's existing components significantly reduces development time and effort for Selendra.

**2. Customization and Flexibility:** Substrate provides a high degree of customization, enabling Selendra to tailor its blockchain to meet specific requirements and goals. This flexibility is essential for realizing Selendra's vision of a decentralized infrastructure empowering enterprises and developers.

**3. Safety and Performance:** Substrate's use of Rust as its primary programming language ensures both safety guarantees and performance benefits. This ensures the reliability and efficiency of Selendra's blockchain, critical for building trust in the network.

**4. Integration with Polkadot Ecosystem:** Substrate serves as the foundation for Polkadot, aligning Selendra with the broader Polkadot ecosystem. This integration enables seamless connections with other blockchains within the Polkadot network, facilitating interoperability and expanding Selendra's reach.

**5. Interoperability:** Substrate's architecture is designed to enable interoperability, perfectly aligning with Selendra's cross-chain integration ambitions. This interoperability allows Selendra to connect with various blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, through bridges.

Polkadot Network and Ecosystem

The Polkadot network seamlessly complements Selendra's objectives. When Selendra becomes a parachain on Polkadot, it will facilitate token transfers between other parachains and parathreads within the network.

We can also leverage independently developed bridges to connect non-Polkadot chains to the network, including bridges to Ethereum. Polkadot's unique interoperability model aligns perfectly with Selendra's cross-chain integration ambitions, serving as a critical enabling technology for realizing the Selendra vision.

Equally significant as the technical considerations, we hold deep respect for the individuals within the Polkadot ecosystem and its community, including contributors from Parity, the Web3 Foundation, and various other projects. We extend our gratitude to them for creating exceptional tools that empower small teams like Selendra to achieve what was once unimaginable.

Selendra's strategic alignment with Substrate underscores its commitment to efficient, scalable, and interoperable development. It positions Selendra at the forefront of Web3 innovation, fostering a collaborative environment to drive the industry's evolution. Selendra extends its gratitude to the creators of Polkadot, Substrate, and the wider Web3 ecosystem for pioneering tools that empower projects like Selendra to turn the unimaginable into reality.
